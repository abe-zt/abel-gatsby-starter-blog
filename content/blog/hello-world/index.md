This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

 I am a California State University San Marcos graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Join me as I embark on the recent college-graduate journey at Planing Center in Carlsbad, CA.

In this space I will be sharing my learning experience as the Summer 2019 Front-End intern at Planning Center, along with my thoughts and and reflections relating to the workspace. Though my time as an intern may be limited, I hope to make the most of it and learn as much as possible from the talented team at Planning Center.
