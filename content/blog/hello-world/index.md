This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I am a California State University San Marcos graduate with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science. Join me as I embark on the recent college-graduate journey at Planing Center in Carlsbad, CA.

In this space I will be sharing my experience as the Summer 2019 Front-End intern at Planning Center, along with my thoughts and reflections relating to the workspace. I look forward to working with (and learning from) the talented team at Planning Center.
